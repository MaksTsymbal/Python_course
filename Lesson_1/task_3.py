# task_3
# Write a program, which has two print statements to print the following text
# (capital letters "O" and "H", made from "#" symbols):
# #########
# #       #
# #       #
# #       #
# #########
#
# #       #
# #       #
# #########
# #       #
# #       #
#
# Pay attention that usage of spaces is forbidden, as well as creating the whole result
# text string using """ """, use '\n' and '\t' symbols instead.

# Print letter 'O'
print("\n#########", "\n#\t\t#", "\n#\t\t#", "\n#\t\t#", "\n#########")
# Print letter 'H'
print("\n#\t\t#", "\n#\t\t#", "\n#########", "\n#\t\t#", "\n#\t\t#")
