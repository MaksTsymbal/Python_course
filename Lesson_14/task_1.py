# Create a base class named Animal with a method called talk and then create two subclasses:
# Dog and Cat, and make their own implementation of the method talk be different.
# For instance, Dog’s can be to print ‘woof woof’, while Cat’s can be to print ‘meow’.
# Also, create a simple generic function, which takes as input instance of a Cat or Dog classes
# and performs talk method on input parameter.
